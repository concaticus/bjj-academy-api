# ðŸ¥‹ BJJ Academy Management System

In accordance with the requirements of the Web API Server project, this application is designed to organise and manage operations at a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) academy. It supports the management of students, instructors, classes, schedules, and attendance records.

The system helps academies track student progress, organise class timetables, and record attendance in a structured and efficient way.
